            <p><strong>Review:</strong>I have never sat in silence as long as I did after this book...no joke...the beginning is hard and can be uninteresting, but once you've made it a decent way in...there is not such thing as putting this book down. This book might and is the best thing I have ever read, no doubt about it. The ending made me hate and love my life and I am counting down the days till the net one comes out! Lauren Roberts is an incredible author and the way she writes just speaks to me and Its almost as if I can imagen perfectly what is being painted before me. This book truly in incredible and I can't wait for they next one</p>

            <h3>It Start With Us</h3>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Colleen Hoover</p>
            <p><strong>Genre:</strong>  Romance novel, New adult fiction, Contemporary romance</p>

            <p><strong>Review:</strong> I haven't even finished this book yet I cant hold myself from saying that this is one of the best books I've ever read, period! When I started reading it, i thought okay its another romantic trope where the couple ends up together after all the fake dating stuff or some other trivial issues, atleast that's how most of the romance novels work, you know. 

                But this book has been taking my breaths away ever since I started reading it! It's not in the world like what I had thought it'd be, it's a totally unique, heart touching, highly emotional, brilliant piece of work! One that explores a different side of love that not many authors try experimenting. The author has done a stellar job in putting the emotions into words in the most perfect way possible. I'm seriously in love with this book and can't wait to read it al out! Please don't leave this book unread, it is surely one everybody must read in their life!‚ù§
                
                Colleen Hoover deserves a great deal by the way!</p>
